Which name sticks, “Stonehenge II” or “Superhenge”?

Researchers have determined that there were once about 90 stones similar to the ones at Stonehenge 3km away from Stonehenge.
The new stones stand 15 feet high and are thought to be knocked over after the end of the pre ‘Stonehenge main phase’ religion.
