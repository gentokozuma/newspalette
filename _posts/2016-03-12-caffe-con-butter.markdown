Caffe con Butter?

He has lost 100 lb, IQ raised by 20 points, and lowered his biological age.

Dave Asprey of the Bulletproof diet has opened his first shop, Bulletproof Coffee, in Santa Monica along with an announcement that Bulletproof has raised $9 million from Trinity Ventures. What makes this coffee shop so special is his secret ingredient for his coffee, butter.
Asprey is a biohacker who has been building a following among the Silicon Valley crowd. He has lost 100 lb, IQ raised by 20 points, and lowered his biological age. He claims he was inspired by the yak butter infused tea he tried in Tibet.
Quote “I felt amazing,” he recounts. “Normally, you feel like you’re dying at [18,000 feet] elevation. It’s really uncomfortable. I asked myself, ‘Why am I feeling so amazing?’ I want to feel like this all the time.”

Asprey also has plans to sell something called FatWater, which contains water and fats from coconut oil.
