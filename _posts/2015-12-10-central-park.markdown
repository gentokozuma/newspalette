Article starts with "Donald Trump owns Central Park." And then continues with "at least not yet." Sinister, no? The licensing fee cost him $1625 for 5 classes of use. Central Park has not challenged him on this case yet and a law firm claims that it is unlikely he will use it because of the status of Central Park. While anyone can register a trademark, one does not always have the right to it.
