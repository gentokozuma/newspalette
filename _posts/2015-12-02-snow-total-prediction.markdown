The U.S. Weather Prediction Center has now made a tool to inform the public about the probability of “plowable snow” seven days in advance. This will benefit municipalities, retailers, airlines and many other industries dependent of weather. The U.S.  Weather Prediction Center has tested these forecasts models for three years and claims that this tool was possible due to advances in computer forecasting modeling. This is considered a breakthrough because the amount of snowfall could not be predicted a week in advance prior to this release.

"Plowable snow" is 2 inches or more.
